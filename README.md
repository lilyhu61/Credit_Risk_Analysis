# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
In this project, we use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. And We will evaluate 
the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

We adopted the following procedure:
- Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
- Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
- Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.

## Results
- RandomOverSampler model
